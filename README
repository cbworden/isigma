ISIGMA
------

Bootstrap EMSC data to compute standard deviation.

Not for production.

Implementation notes
====================

For MacOS: 

matplotlib is required. If using conda, and you get this error:

- UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure.

Then edit the file ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc and change 'agg' to 'tkagg'.
